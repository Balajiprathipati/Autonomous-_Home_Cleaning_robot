# Autonomous Floor Cleaner using Arduino

This project focuses on building a smart **Autonomous Floor Cleaning Robot** using Arduino. The robot is designed to clean surfaces without human intervention, navigating its environment using ultrasonic sensors to avoid obstacles.

## 💡 Features

- Fully autonomous floor cleaning
- Obstacle detection and avoidance using ultrasonic sensors
- Compact and cost-effective design
- Powered by Arduino Uno
- Controlled cleaning mechanism using servo motors and DC motors
- Rechargeable battery-powered mobility

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Arduino UNO** – Microcontroller board for controlling the robot
- 
- **Ultrasonic Sensors** – For obstacle detection
- **DC Motors with Motor Driver (L298N)** – For mobility
- **Servo Motor** – For cleaning mechanism
- **Battery Pack** – Portable power source
- **Wheels, Castor Wheel** – Robot chassis movement

## 🔧 How it Works

1. The robot uses **ultrasonic sensors** to detect obstacles in its path.
2. When an obstacle is detected, the robot changes its direction to avoid collision.
3. **Servo motors** rotate the cleaning brush underneath.
4. The robot moves forward, covering the floor surface, and performs cleaning while avoiding obstacles.
5. It continues this loop autonomously.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Upload the Arduino code to the Arduino Uno using the Arduino IDE.
2. Assemble the components as per the circuit diagram.
3. Power on the robot and place it on the floor.
4. It will begin cleaning automatically

## 🙌 Future Scope

- Integration of AI 
  
- Vacuum suction module for better cleaning
